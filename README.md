This branch fixes an issue with the ATM card being displayed properly.

# ARitz Cracker Bank - Community Edition
The best ATM system for GMod is now free!

## If you're a GMod Lua developer read this!
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/ARitz-Cracker/ARCBank/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Why free?
Well, I haven't been actively providing quality customer support and proper maintenence for my addons for quite some time. So the best thing to do is allow the community to give it the care and attention it deserves. A lot of people still use it all the time, so it definetly doesn't deserve to be neglected.

## Why use ARCBank??

* This addon drops %60 of your money, and deletes %20 when you die (this is configurable)
* Players who store their money in ARCBank don't have to worry about getting mugged!
* ARCBank accounts are savings accounts, and you will gain interest over time. (The % you gain is configurable)
* You can use the card machines for transactions instead of dropping money to people.
* You can have group accounts to share money with your friends.
* You can transfer money to other players even when they are offline.
* Optional MySQL support, if you have multiple servers, you can use ARCBank to sync your economy across your community!

## I'm not convinced.
Well, here's some more cool stuff!

ARCBank supports customizing your ATM to have custom models!

[Here's a video of me testing the touchscreen ATM before it was released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1PWLeP9H3A)

[And here's a tutorial on how to make your bank card have a custom look!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9izqZ9r5U)

ARCBank is very very customizable, and is developer friendly with an extensive API (Documentation located https://www.aritzcracker.ca/docs/arcbank/ )

When it comes to administration, the permissions system can differentiate between moderators who can view accounts, and admins who can edit accounts. Each transaction is also logged, so you will always have a record of everyone's finances!

ARCBank has become a staple of the GMod roleplay experience over the last 4 years! I'm sure you'll appriciate everything it has to offer. ðŸ˜„
